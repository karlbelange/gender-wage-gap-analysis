# gender-wage-gap-analysis
This project looks at how median earnings changed over time for male and female workers in Champaign County, Illinois, from 2005 to 2022. The dataset included earnings for both total and full-time workers. I cleaned the data in Python by removing dollar signs and commas, then reshaped it using melt() to make it easier to work with.

I used Altair to create line charts showing trends for each group. The charts made it clear that men consistently earned more than women, but the gap did shrink over time. For example, the pay gap for full-time workers went from $10,000 in 2005 to $5,000 by 2019. Overall, it was a great way to practice data cleaning, reshaping, and turning insights into visuals.
